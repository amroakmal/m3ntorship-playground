# Each pod must have a separate name from other pods, because pods see each other, so each of them
# must have different name, and the pod name is specified in the metada/name.

# Each pod can have more than one container, and each pod can have same container name and specs, as we said
# above that pods see each other only from top view, but don't see each others' internal content aka containers.
